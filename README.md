# Overvoltage Protection System

## Objective
To protect electrical appliances from damage due to overvoltage conditions.

## Description
This project continuously monitors the input voltage. When the voltage exceeds a preset safe limit, the relay disconnects the load automatically and reconnects it when voltage returns to normal.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Voltage Sensor
- Relay Module
- Load (Bulb/Motor)
- Power Supply

## Working Principle
The voltage is sensed and compared with a predefined threshold. If overvoltage occurs, the relay isolates the load to prevent damage.

## Applications
- Domestic appliance protection
- Industrial electrical systems
- Power distribution safety
